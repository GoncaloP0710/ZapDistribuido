## Project overview

The aim of this project is to give students the opportunity to put the topics they have studied in the lecture and lab classes to practice. In more detail, in this project the students are asked to build a secure P2P messaging app, similar to WhatsApp/Signal/Telegram. Next is a list of requirements for the app.

BASIC REQUIREMENTS (10 points):
-  The messaging app should be as decentralized as possible
- The app should allow sending messages between any two users with end-to-end encryption
guarantees(i.e., only receiver and recipient of a message should be able to learn its contents)
- Communication between users should provide standard reliability guarantees, i.e., message
delivery, ordering, etc.
- A client interface should also be implemented for testing and visualization purposes,
showing the list of conversations of a user and the contents of a specified conversation
